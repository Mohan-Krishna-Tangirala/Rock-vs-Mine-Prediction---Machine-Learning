# Rock vs. Mine Prediction 

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether an object beneath a submarine is a rock or a mine using sonar data. 
The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify sonar signals based on the characteristics of the objects they reflect off.

## Libraries Used

- NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem using sonar data. The logistic regression model achieved satisfactory accuracy, and the predictive system can classify new sonar data effectively.
